## Help Desk

If you have any problems with this extension or would like give us your
feedback you can do so on our [Help Desk][].

## Questions?

If you want help creating your own templates you should read the guide within
the Options page of the extension (click the question mark symbol in the
navigation bar or the link on the Templates tab).

Alternatively, you can take a look at `docs/*.html` within the browsers
sub-directory within this repository to get a better understanding of what the
code is doing.
